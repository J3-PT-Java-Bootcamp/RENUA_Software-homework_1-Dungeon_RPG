# Basics-of-Java-homework


Welcome to our project we are RENUA a team consisting of five members:

Joel
Sergi Jacas Puig
Sara
Ivan
Pau

We are really glad that you are testing our game, we hope that you enjoy it.



## FIRST BATTLE

(You will see that most of the options are [DISABLED] that is because until there has been a battle you will not be able to use them)

The easiest and quickest way to get the overall experience is to make  random generated teams (You also have the option to import your party, we will explain it later):

In the main menu press 1 to generate battle.

You will be asked to choose how many members there will be in each party. (There’s no maximum limit to how many fighters you want to generate so feel free to go wild!).

Once the parties have been generated you will get a message saying so.

Now you are ready to run your first battle!


Next step is to run the battle. To do so press 2.

Then you will have two options: 

(1)Simulate battle (all the fights will be randomly generated, you will get the result in an instant!)

(2)Run battle choosing fighters (Each fight you will be asked to choose the fighter of each team that will participate)



## STATS OF THE FIGHTS

Each fight is presented with the stats of each fighter.
Here you will be able to see in a glance the outcome of the fight.

For each fighter you will get the same info:

The name,
the remaining hp (in brackets you will have the damage that the character has taken in the fight)

the remaining stamina/mana (depending on which type of character is)

the damage that has inflicted (in the current match) along with the times each type of attack has been used.

At the end you will see a sentence with the winner: 

You will get the name of the killer and the name of the deceased.

There is a special case where both fighters can kill each other at the same type then you will get a different sentence.

In between the fights you will have the remaining  participants of each team.


## ENDING

Once a team has ran out of members, the battle will reach its conclusion.

A text will indicate the victorious team.

Then you will have the option to see the graveyard. 

By pressing 5 you will access it, then you have to choose which team’s graveyard you want to visit.

Then you will see a list of all the deceased party members.

Once the fight is over, you can start a new battle.




## ADDITIONAL OPTIONS


Export Party- if you want to export the team that has been generated to use it in other battles or even to modify the stats of the members, you can choose this option. 
IMPORTANT!! Keep in mind that the generated file will have the name of the team you are exporting. (Just the name itself).


Import Party- This option is accessible when you access generate battle. It will look for a csv with the name you supply (you have to write the name without the extension) and import each character. 
IMPORTANT!!
If it has been created using the export party option, the csv file will be the party’s name.
If you have manually created the csv file you have to put it in the root directory to be able to import it
